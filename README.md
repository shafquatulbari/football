# My Personal Project

## A Fantasy Football Team Application

What my *application* will do:
- Show stats of players in a football team.
- Show name of team and the list of players.
- Create teams, add players, modify stats.

Who will use my *application*:
- Football/Soccer fans.

Why is this project of interest to me:
- I like football/soccer so working on a project based on the sport will be much easier and fun for me.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new team and add it to a list of teams.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a team and add a new player to the team.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a team and view a list of the players on that team.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a player on a team and add a new statistic for that player, for example, the number of goals scored in a game.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a team and list all the players on that team.
- As a user, I should be able to save the progress of my whole work from the session.
- As a user, I should be able to load the saved file of my previous session's progress.


## User Stories for Phase 3:
- As a user, I want to be able to add players to the team by setting their stats.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the players on screen after being added to the team.
- As a user, I should be able to save the progress of my whole work from the session.
- As a user, I should be able to load the saved file of my previous session's progress.
- As a user, I want to be able to click a button to reveal the best player in the team based on total goals and assists.


## User Stories for Phase 4: Task 2
- I made appropriate use of Map interface in my code. For JSON Reader and JSON Writer, it makes use of JSONObject Class 
and inside JSON Object class it makes use of the map interface.    

## User Stories for Phase 4: Task 3
- When I use the console application, The LeagueApp class has single field of League, Team, Player, JsonReader, JsonWriter 
(So this is an association relationship). League class has list of type Team. Team class has list of type Player. 
(So these are association relationships). League, Team and Player class implements Writable interface. 
(These are dependency relationships).
